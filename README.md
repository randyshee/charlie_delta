## Quick Start

This project uses `uv` for fast and reliable Python package management:

```bash
# Create and activate a virtual environment
uv venv
source .venv/bin/activate

# Install the package and all development dependencies
uv pip install -e ".[dev]"
```

See notebooks for the tutorials and bug reports.
